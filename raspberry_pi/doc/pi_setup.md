# Raspberry Pi Setup

This is the new setup procedure for 2027, which does not
use the unmaintained "WPILibPi" distribution.

We use only the Raspberry Pi 5.  We have a bunch of 4's,
but we don't use them, they're too slow.

## Burn the SD Card

* Make sure your laptop is connected to the internet.
* Choose a name for the camera.  The camera IP range is between
  10.1.0.30 and 10.1.0.35, so a good camera name would be
  "camera33" or "camera34".

* Use the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) app.

* Choose the Raspberry Pi OS Lite (64-bit) "Trixie" image.
    * The "lite" option is behind the "other" option.  Don't use the "full" image.
    * Use the name you selected above.
    * fill in the localization using "los angeles"
    * add a user "pi" with password "raspberry"
    * enable SSH with password authentication
    * don't do anything with the wifi setup
    * do not use "raspberry pi connect"

## Turn off the radios

Turn off the wifi and bluetooth radios (because FRC prohibits them)

* In the `bootfs` volume, find the file called `config.txt`, using Notepad, and add these lines at the top:

```ini
dtoverlay=disable-wifi-pi5
dtoverlay=disable-bt-pi5
```
* Save the file with ctrl-S.


## Configure the network

Set up the static ethernet addressing scheme.

* In the `bootfs` volume, edit file called `network-config`, using Notepad, and make it look like this: (choose an address between 10.1.0.30 and 10.1.0.35)

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      addresses: 
        - 10.1.0.31/24
      nameservers:
        addresses:
          - 8.8.8.8
      routes:
        - to: default
          via: 10.1.0.2
      optional: true
```
* Save the file with ctrl-S.

What this means:

* 8.8.8.8 is the google nameserver
* 10.1.0.2 is your laptop (for bridging)
* `optional` to avoid holding up the boot.


## Turn on the Pi

* Close Notepad.
* "Eject" the SD card from your laptop.
* Install the SD card in the pi
* Reassemble the Pi in its case
* IMPORTANT: WRITE THE IP ADDRESS ON THE PI CASE, or you won't know what it is, later.
* Turn it on

## Set up your laptop network

Give the Pi access to the internet:

* Connect your laptop to wifi, and "share" the connection
  * On windows, sharing wifi changes the Ethernet address, so you need to change it back:
* Change your ethernet address to `10.1.0.2`.

## Connect

* Connect the Pi to your laptop with an ethernet cable,
  or through a switch if you're working on many Pi's at the same time.
* Get a command window ("cmd" on Win11)
* type `ssh pi@10.1.0.31` (or whatever the address is)
* use password `raspberry`
* verify the pi can see the internet (`ping 8.8.8.8`)

## Update the Pi

* Make sure the OS is up to date.

```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade 
```

## Install Pi Camera Support

* Install camera packages.

```
sudo apt install libcamera-dev 
sudo apt install python3-picamera2 
```

## Set up Python

To avoid dependency between our app and the Raspberry Pi
python installation, we use the python "virtual environment"
feature.

* Create a virtual environment.

The env needs to see the system packages, so:
```
python -m venv --system-site-packages ./env
```
* Install required libraries in the virtual environment.
```
source ./env/bin/activate
python -m pip install numpy
python -m pip install opencv-python
python -m pip install robotpy
python -m pip install robotpy-apriltag
python -m pip install robotpy-cscore
```

## Install Supervisord

We use [supervisor](https://supervisord.org/index.html)
for management: stop, start, and looking at logs.

For these steps, the ssh password is "raspberry".

* Copy the supervisord conf file to the pi.
* Install supervisord.
    * Because we want it to run at startup, we use the
      system package.
* Move the `supervisord.conf` file to the privileged location.
* Get supervisor to read it.
```
scp supervisor/supervisord.conf pi@10.1.0.31:/tmp
ssh pi@10.1.0.31
sudo apt install supervisor
sudo mv /tmp/supervisord.conf /etc/supervisor
sudo systemctl restart supervisor
supervisorctl status
```

If you haven't yet installed the app code, you should see supervisor
complain that it can't find it:

```
app    FATAL    can't find command '/home/pi/env/bin/python'
```

At this point, your laptop browser should show the supervisor
web page at `http://10.1.0.31:9001/`, with the red "fatal" status.

## Troubleshooting

What if the steps above don't work?

* LED flashing 4 slow, 3 fast
  * This indicates hardware damage.

* you can try flashing the EEPROM, using a different image from the 
  raspberry pi imager.  if it succeeds, the green LED flashes forever.

* Pi can't reach 8.8.8.8.
  * The WHS network disallows bridging.  Run the procedure
    above on a more-friendly network (e.g. at home).

## Appendix

For developent, we need this, but I think not for the pi:
```
sudo apt install python3-aiohttp 
```
